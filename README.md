# Warehouse Storage Optimisation

Optimizing your warehouse means examining every corner of your infrastructure and every facet of your workflows and processes to identify and correct inefficiencies. Not only does warehouse optimization result in a healthier bottom line, but it also improves key warehouse metrics like accurate orders and on-time delivery.

Our solution for this optimization problem attempts to use Machine Learning techniques to provide a scalable and fast solution to this problem. We used several models like Decision tree, Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost classifier, k-Nearest Neighbours, etc to solve this issue.

The highest accuracy we obtained so far is 89% in Random Forest Classifier. The following graph shows our accuracy plot for RFC at various values of n_estimators
